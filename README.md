# ðŸš² Nantes Mobility â€“ Bicloo Bike Sharing Analysis

**Nantes Mobility** is an open-source data project focused on analyzing the Bicloo public bike-sharing system in the city of Nantes.  
It serves as the foundation for a broader data platform initiative that will grow over time.

ðŸ“š This project is designed as a **learning environment** to practice real-world data engineering skills â€” from ingestion to transformation and visualization.  
ðŸŽ¯ The goal is to build valuable, actionable insights from open urban mobility data, while contributing transparently to the open-source community.

Whether you're a data professional, urban planner, or simply curious about how data can drive smarter cities â€” this project is open for collaboration, feedback, and evolution. Feel free to reach out if you have questions, ideas, or would like to contribute.

## Objectives

- Ingest live data from Bicloo stations in Nantes (status, location, availability)
- Transform and model the data using **dbt**
- Visualize insights with **Power BI** dashboards
- Build a foundation to analyze and share key mobility KPIs

## Data Workflow

### Ingestion (Hourly)

- A GitHub Action triggers a Python script every hour.
- Data is fetched from Nantes' open data API (Bicloo stations).
- Stored in Snowflake in a `raw` schema.

### Transformation (Daily)

- dbt models process raw data into:
  - `dim_station`
  - `dim_date`
  - `fact_station_hourly_usage`
- Exposes a clear star schema to Power BI.

## Roadmap

The Nantes Mobility project is just getting started. Here's a preview of the next steps planned to gradually enhance the platform, while keeping simplicity and cost-efficiency in mind:

- Integrate Azure Blob Storage to archive data and reduce Snowflake storage costs

- Create a public static website to share dashboards and key mobility insights

- Add weather data correlation to better understand factors impacting usage

- Identify under-served areas based on spatial and temporal usage patterns

- Generate weekly automated summary reports (PDF or dashboard snapshots)

- Set up an alert system for detecting saturation or abnormal station behavior

- Explore a lightweight multi-city extension, keeping the pipeline configurable

- Keep infrastructure and compute as low-cost and maintainable as possible
